# This is a Web Application for online Food Ordering which is built using ReactJs. This is developed as clone using 'Swiggy's' Live API.

# Note:

# This app's API comes from a different origin, and the browser stops it from making certain calls ('CORS') when you're trying to go online. To see the live application, install the 'Allow CORS' plugin on your browser.
